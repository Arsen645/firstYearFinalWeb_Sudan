                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p class="text">Compass Group is dedicated to supporting the provision of victims of Sudan War.
                    We are a volunteer led organisation, with no paid
                    fundraisers and a mission to deliver the best service possible for the people of
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p class="text">We started off as a small but passiona
                    te group of fundraisers in 1990. Within a few short years,
                    the successful delivery of home-based services gave the movement broader ambitions.
                    This culminated in the
                    world class service we have today. Led currently by two specialist palliative care
                    consultants, there is a
                    professional team that works together to
                    ease the suffering that many serious illnesses inflict. </p>
                <p class="text">We have a board, that is charged with looking after the big picture.
                    However, most of the day-to-day work is done by local committees, dotted
                    around the country. These feed into the main fundraising committee, which reports
                    to the board. </p>

        <h3>What services are provided?</h3>

        <p>We provide a wide range of humanitarian services to support Sudanese individuals
            and families who have been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war. Our pri
            mary focus is on delivering life-saving assistance and helping communities rebu
            ild their lives with dignity and hope.</p>

        <p>One of our key services is the distribution of emergency food and
            clean water to those who have been displaced or are living in conf
            lict-affected areas with limited access to basic necessities. We al
            so offer critical medical support, including first aid, essential med
            ications, and access to healthcare professionals, ensuring that urgent
            health needs are addressed even in the most remote or vulnerable communities.</p>

        <p>For those who have lost their homes, we assist with temporary shelter solutions,
            helping families find safety and stability. In addition, we provide mental health
            and psychosocial support to individuals—especially children—who have experienced t
            rauma as a result of violence, displacement, or loss. We believe that emotional he
            aling is just as important as physical recovery.</p>

        <p>Education is another vital aspect of our work. We offer resources and support to
            help children continue their learning, whether through informal education programs
            or by working with local and international partners to rebuild access to schooling.</p>

        <p>Finally, we help with relocation efforts and family reunification, working to
            bring separated loved ones back together and support displaced individuals in
            finding safer, more stable environments.</p>

        <p>Through all of our services, we strive to restore hope, promote resilience, and
            stand in solidarity with the people of Sudan during one of the most difficult times
            in their history.</p>
