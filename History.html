        The Darfur Crisis and the latest Sudanese conflict (2023) represent some of the most tragic and pro
        longed episodes of violence in Sudan's modern history. These conflicts have been marked by ethnic tensions
        , political instability, and humanitarian disasters. While the Darfur crisis began in the early 2000s, the
         roots of Sudan's ongoing conflict can be traced back even earlier, 
        to the country's history of ethnic and regional divisions, military rule, and marginalization.</p>

            <h3>Background: Power Struggle and Political Transition</h3>
        <p>
          The Darfur crisis is just one chapter in Sudan's complex history of internal conflict. Sudan's long history 
          of civil wars and military regimes culminated in the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 after 
          months of protests against his rule. The Sudanese Revolution succeeded in removing Bashir, and a 
          transitional government was established with civilian and military leadership. However, tensions 
          between the military and civilian factions, along with economic struggles, continued to undermine 
          the transitional government.

          By 2021, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sudanese military, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, 
          head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a powerful paramilitary group, staged a coup against the civilian-l
          ed government. This sparked a political crisis and led to renewed instability.</p>        
          <h3>Outbreak of Conflict (2023)</h3>
          <p>In April 2023, tensions between al-Burhan's Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Dagalo's RSF reached a 
            boiling point. The dispute arose from disagreements over the integration of the RSF into the regular
             army, as mandated by a peace agreement intended to establish a unified military structure.
            The conflict quickly escalated into full-scale fighting between the two factions. Khartoum, the capi
            tal of Sudan, became the battleground. There were reports of airstrikes, artillery bombardments, 
            and intense street battles, causing widespread destruction. The fighting left hundreds dead and d
            isplaced thousands of civilians. 
            Hospitals and residential areas were caught in the crossfire, worsening the humanitarian crisis.</p>







            <h3>Humanitarian Impact</h3>
        <p>
          TAs of mid-2023, Khartoum has been devastated by the violence, with many of the city's infra
          structure, including schools and hospitals, destroyed. More than 1 million people have been 
          isplaced, and tens of thousands have fled to neighboring countries such as Chad. The humanita
          rian situation is d
          ire, with food shortages, lack of medical care, and basic services.</p>

        <p>
          The international community, including the United Nations and African Union, ha
          s called for a ceasefire and dialogue between the warring parties. However, the 
          violence continues with no clear resolution in sight. Many countries have impose
          d sanctions on Sudan's military leaders, but t
          he conflict remains entrenched, and the path to peace appears uncertain.</p>
